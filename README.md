## Password Generator
https://ipan7.github.io/passwordgenhw/

## Description
* A simple password generator given selectable parameters.

## What does the app do?
The app generates a password between 12 and 128 characters long based upon user inputted parameters for password length and use of uppercase characters, lowercase characters, special characters, and numbers.

## How does it work?
It uses a for loop with multiple conditionals linked to multiple character generation functions to produce a password. The conditionals are linked to confirm and prompt variables to determine password generation parameters. These are all subheaded under a generate password function, which is then linked to generate in a text box on the HTML page.

## Challenges
Building a pseudocode skeleton was essential to compartmentalizing and building this application piece by piece!

## Your experience building this app
A lot of googling and reviewing class videos!

## What was difficult
The syntax was definitely challenging for me. I felt that pseudocoding a skeleton for the app was essential to completing it. Also finding a way for my conditionals within the loop to fill in characters for the length of the password when a parameter was deselected was challenging, yet the answer was a deceptively simple one!

## What did you learn
The nuances of "else if, if, and else" are very important.

## How did you go about solving a problem
Repetitive iteration. Change one thing, test the HTML in-browser, then see what broke or needed modification, or if my added implementation was useful.
